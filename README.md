# IB Trading Bot

## Overview

This project is an Interactive Brokers (IB) Trading Bot that is deployed on Amazon Cloud. It integrates with IB's API to perform trading actions, fetch market data, and scan for market opportunities. It also includes functionalities to send PnL information to a Telegram bot at regular intervals.

## Features

- **Market Scanner**: Scans for market opportunities based on predefined criteria.
- **PnL Reporting**: Sends the current PnL information to a Telegram bot every hour.
- **Automated Trading**: Executes trading strategies (strategy scripts not included in this repository).

## Architecture

The project consists of several components:
- `main_ib.py`: The main script that initializes the IB API connection and handles real-time data and trading operations.
- `order_module_ib.py`: Handles order placement and execution logic.
- `market_scanner.py`: Handles market scanning using IB's market scanner functionality.
- `telegram_bot_ib.py`: Sends messages to a Telegram bot.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
- **IB Gateway**: Install and configure IB Gateway on your Amazon Cloud instance.
- **IB Controller**: Install IB Controller to automate the IB Gateway login process.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ib-trading-bot.git
    cd ib-trading-bot
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Bot

1. **Start the IB Gateway**: Use IB Controller to start the IB Gateway automatically.
2. **Set Up Task Scheduler**: Use Amazon Cloud's task scheduler to run the `startGateway.bat` script to ensure the IB Gateway is always running.

### Amazon Cloud

This project runs on an Amazon Cloud instance. The task scheduler is set to run the trading bot script at regular intervals to ensure it remains active and can handle trading operations without manual intervention.

### Strategy Integration

The trading strategies are written in a separate script (not included in this repository) and can be integrated with the main script to perform automated trading actions.

### Telegram Bot Integration

The project uses the `python-telegram-bot` library to send PnL updates to a specified Telegram bot. The bot token and chat ID need to be configured in the `telegram_bot_ib.py` script.

## Usage

1. **Update Configuration**: Modify the configuration files to include your IB account details, bot token, chat ID, and any other necessary configurations.
2. **Deploy to Amazon Cloud**: Ensure your Amazon Cloud instance is set up to run the scripts as per the schedule.
3. **Monitor Telegram**: Receive regular updates on your Telegram bot for PnL and other important notifications.
